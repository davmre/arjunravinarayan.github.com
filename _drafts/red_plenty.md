title: "Red Plenty"
---

for a book written by a non-russian speaker, gives a compelling picture of everyday life under the ussr. 

- getting inside krushchev's head: the view of communism as a noble enterprise. instead of just 'muddling along' through random market transactions, people seize control and actively plan the world they want to have
- marx intending for socialism to be realized in an industrialized state that already had developed the means of production. (so proper socialism is still to come?)
- working from the problem vs working from the photograph
- the total isolation of the soviets from western 20th-century economic thought.
- I don't remember what was in the intro to part II, but it was awesome. 
- brown eyed boys are fleeting and should be picked while in their prime :-)
